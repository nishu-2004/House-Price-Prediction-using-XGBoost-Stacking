***House Price Prediction using XGBoost Stacking***
This project aims to predict house prices using an XGBoost-based stacking model, leveraging multiple regression algorithms for improved accuracy.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is California Housing Prices, containing various features like median income, population, and house age to predict median house prices.

**Methodology**

Data Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
Feature Engineering â€“ Selecting the most relevant features for the model.
Model Stacking â€“ Combining multiple regression models with XGBoost as the final estimator.
Evaluation Metrics â€“ Measuring model performance using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score.

**Results**
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.4088
 Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.5895
 RÂ² Score: 0.7348

**Technologies Used**
Python
XGBoost, Scikit-Learn
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
